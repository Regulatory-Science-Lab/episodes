\title{Summarize Patient Transitions Across States}
\usage{
state_numbers_summary(drug_transitions, flatiron = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{drug_transitions}{A data frame containing patient state transitions.
Must include at least \code{patientid}, \code{linestartdate}, \code{lineenddate}, and \code{state}.}

\item{flatiron}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the function will join Flatiron demographic
data (from a hardcoded path) to annotate patient gender.}
}
\value{
A data frame with total transitions between defined states and
patient sex distribution. Includes:
\describe{
\item{N_on_to_prog}{Transitions from on-treatment to progression}
\item{N_on_to_death}{Transitions from on-treatment to death}
\item{N_on_to_off}{Transitions from on-treatment to off-treatment}
\item{N_off_to_prog}{Transitions from off-treatment to progression}
\item{N_off_to_death}{Transitions from off-treatment to death}
\item{N_prog_to_death}{Transitions from progression to death}
\item{N_total}{Total number of unique patients}
\item{N_prop_F}{Proportion of female patients}
\item{N_prop_M}{Proportion of male patients}
}
}
\description{
This function computes summary counts of transitions between treatment states
(e.g., on-treatment to progression, progression to death), optionally joined
with demographic gender data from Flatiron.
