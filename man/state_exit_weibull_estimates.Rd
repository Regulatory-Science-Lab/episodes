\title{Estimate Weibull parameters for state transitions}
\usage{
state_exit_weibull_estimates(drug_transitions, lines)
}
\arguments{
\item{drug_transitions}{A dataframe of treatment episodes with start/end dates and states.}

\item{lines}{A dataframe of treatment line data including prior lines and next line dates.}
}
\value{
A tibble with Weibull shape and scale estimates for each transition state.
}
\description{
Fits Weibull models for different treatment states (e.g., on treatment, off treatment, progression)
using survival time and covariates such as line of therapy.
