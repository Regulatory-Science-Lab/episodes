\title{Generate Cutoff Values for Treatment Gaps, Progression, and Death}
\usage{
generate_cutoffs(drug_episodes)
}
\arguments{
\item{drug_episodes}{A data.frame of drug episodes, including columns:
\code{linestartdate}, \code{lineenddate}, \code{progression_date},
\code{death_date}, and \code{chemo_line}.}
}
\value{
A list with three numeric cutoff values:
\describe{
\item{\code{next_line_cutoff}}{Median number of days to next line of treatment}
\item{\code{progression_cutoff}}{75th percentile of time to progression}
\item{\code{death_cutoff}}{75th percentile of time to death among single-line patients}
}
}
\description{
This function computes data-driven cutoff thresholds for defining:
\itemize{
\item the gap between treatment lines,
\item the time to progression after chemotherapy, and
\item the time to death in patients with only one line and a known progression.
}
}
\details{
These cutoffs are useful for labeling transitions (e.g., censoring vs. death vs. progression)
in real-world oncology datasets.

The function calculates:
\itemize{
\item The \strong{next line cutoff} as the 50th percentile (median) of days between end of one line and start of next.
\item The \strong{progression cutoff} as the 75th percentile of time to progression from end of chemo line.
\item The \strong{death cutoff} as the 75th percentile of time to death, calculated only for patients with a single line and a known progression date.
}

These thresholds can be used as rule-based criteria in modeling progression-free survival or treatment state transitions.
